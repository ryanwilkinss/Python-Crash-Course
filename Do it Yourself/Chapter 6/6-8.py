# Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a 
# pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name. 
# Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list 
# and as you do print everything you know about each pet.
# Note: When I decided to post solutions and wrote complete programs to solve 
# each exercise, I realized this problem was not as well phrased as it should 
# have been. It doesn’t really make sense to name each dictionary for the pet 
# it describes; that information should really be included in the dictionary, 
# rather than being used as the name of the dictionary. This solution reflects 
# that approach.
# Make an empty list to store the pets in.
# Make an empty list to store the pets in.
pets = []

# Make individual pets, and store each one in the list.
