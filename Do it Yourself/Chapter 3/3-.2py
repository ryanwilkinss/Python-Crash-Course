# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
# should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name.

name = 'Elliott', 'Andreas', 'Scotty'
print(f'Hey {name[0].title()}, hows it going?')
print(f'Hey {name[1].lower()}, hows it going?')
print(f'Hey {name[2].upper()}, hows it going?')
