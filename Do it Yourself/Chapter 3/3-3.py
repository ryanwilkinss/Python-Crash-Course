# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
# motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
# to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a
# Honda motorcycle.”

motorcycle_list = 'ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha'
print(f'I would like to own a {motorcycle_list[0].title()} one day.')
print(f'I would like to own a {motorcycle_list[1].title()} one day.')
print(f'I would like to own a {motorcycle_list[2].title()} one day.')
